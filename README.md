# About
This code trains an AI to play and beat Flappy Bird EXTREME, a slightly harder version of Flappy Bird created by yours truly. The AI is trained by using the NEAT Python module to evolve a neural network by creating multiple generations of neural networks. 

The basics of evolving neural networks:

# Process
First, I would like to give an enormous shoutout to the “Tech With Tim” youtube channel. This project created primarily by following the tutorials available on his channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHA-elMrxI).

After completing his tutorials and building my own AI, however, I discovered that normal Flappy Bird was slightly too easy to beat using ML. Because the game is so simple, an AI that could beat flappy bird would often be created within the first three generations. I made Flappy Bird EXTREME to push the limits of what AI could do. In Flappy Bird EXTREME, the gaps between pipes are smaller and the game moves 50% faster. The graphics are also cooler. 

# How do I run your code?
Just run *flappy_bird.py* and watch the AI train itself automatically!

Or, click the Gitpod link below to run my code in a free online IDE.
